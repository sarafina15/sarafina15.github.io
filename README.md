- <b>üì∞Detecting Fake News </b> https://github.com/sarafina15/detecting-fake-news

  The goal of this project is to build a model capable of detecting fake news in online content. With the proliferation of misinformation, particularly on social media platforms, this project focuses on creating a system that can classify news articles or social media posts as either fake or real. By doing so, we aim to contribute to improving the reliability of information and aiding users in identifying trustworthy content.
Fake news is not a new concept. Stories, fairy tales, tall tales, rumors, what says, gossip, and did you knows have been around since people first learned to communicate. However, over the past century, we have seen the evolution and availability of media and news progress at a tremendous pace. It wasn‚Äôt so long ago; people got their news by sitting down and reading the paper while they drank coffee. Today, we can get the run down on sports, weather, local events, and national headlines by simply stating a request with the word ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù. All the information a person could want, literally in the palm of your hand when you want it, where you want it. With all this information, how are we to decide what information is accurate or not? As media competes for headlines, how do we determine what is false or misleading?
