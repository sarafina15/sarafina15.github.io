<h2>üë©‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects:</h2>
 
- <b>üç∑Inventory Management using 2020 Iowa Liquor data

  The objective of this project is to build an inventory management model for liquor retailers, using the 2020 Iowa Liquor Data. The model aims to optimize inventory levels by predicting sales trends, identifying popular and slow-moving products, and providing recommendations for stock management. The goal is to reduce excess inventory, minimize stockouts, and maximize profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction.
Effective inventory management is crucial for maintaining profitability. Liquor retailers must balance the need to stock popular products without overstocking slow-moving items. This can help reduce both excess inventory and stockouts, leading to improved sales and customer satisfaction.

- <b>üé∂How to Use data to Enhance Your Music Experience </b>

  Using data to enhance your music experience can involve several innovative approaches, whether you're a listener looking to enjoy music more deeply or a creator aiming to produce and distribute your music more effectively.
In today‚Äôs digital age, music streaming platforms have transformed how we listen to music. Among these platforms, Spotify stands out not only for its vast music library but also for its personalized recommendations. Ever wondered how Spotify curates‚Äô playlists and suggests songs that seem to know your taste better than your closest friends? The answer lies in their ingenious use of big data.
Spotify stands out as a prime example of a company effectively utilizing big data to create a deeply personalized user experience, particularly through its ‚ÄúDiscover Weekly‚Äù playlists and targeted recommendations, all powered by sophisticated algorithms that analyze vast amounts of user listening habits and preferences. 
Discover new music: Based on patterns of your listening habits, services provide custom playlists (like Spotify‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiscover Weekly‚Äù) to introduce you to music you might not find otherwise.
- <b>‚úàIs Travelling by Air a safe way to travel? </b>

  Although the airline industry started more than a century ago in 1903, it took this industry more than 20 years after that to turn airlines into a commonplace for transportation. Between 1903 and 1925, it would take courage to get onto an airplane because everyone at that time thought that it was a risky endeavor. Throughout the years, airlines have seen many innovations in both technological changes and safety enhancement. 

- <b>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èPredictive Maintenance: Schedule Maintenance by estimating the time to Failure</b>

  Predictive maintenance lets you find the optimum time to schedule maintenance by estimating the time to failure. It also pinpoints problems in your machinery and helps you identify the parts that need to be fixed. Using predictive maintenance, you can minimize downtime and maximize equipment lifetime.
- <b>üé∂Spotify Data Analysis Project</b>

  Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming platform with various features, including sharing songs freely and viewing the lyrics while playing the Json data sources. Finding the top trending songs and creating playlists based on listeners' preferences.
The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Spotify‚Äôs vast music dataset to identify top trending songs, listener preferences, and create personalized playlists. This analysis will help understand user behavior, song popularity patterns, and can assist in enhancing the recommendation systems to improve user experience.
The project provides valuable insights into user preferences and song trends on Spotify. By analyzing streaming data, listener behavior, and song characteristics, the model can predict which songs are likely to become popular, create personalized playlists, and improve Spotify‚Äôs recommendation engine. Additionally, the findings reveal how external factors (such as social media influence) can drastically alter the popularity of songs.

- <b>üîàSales Prediction Using Social Media Ads- Time Series analysis</b>

  The primary goal of this project is to predict future sales based on the influence of social media advertising. By leveraging time series analysis, we aim to model the relationship between advertising campaigns and sales performance over time. This will help businesses make informed decisions regarding their marketing strategies and optimize their advertising spend.
Time series forecasting is a technique that uses historical data to make predictions about future events. In this case, past sales data from a company is analyzed to predict future sales. 
Predicting sales of a company needs time series data of that company and based on that data the model can predict the future sales of that company or product.
Predicting whether a customer will purchase a product is a form of classification problem. Social media data can be leveraged to understand customer sentiments, behaviors, and preferences
Social media data will predict whether a customer will purchase or not purchase.


- <b>üí≤401 K contributions ‚Äì The Correlation on how age groups or gender might be affected </b>

  The primary goal of this project is to analyze 401(k) contribution patterns to identify correlations with factors such as age, gender, years of service, and the effect of an enhanced match program introduced after July 1, 2016. Specifically, we aim to understand how these factors influence employee participation, contribution amounts, and overall funding. By doing so, we can help a financial institution managing 401(k) plans optimize their programs, identify gaps in participation, and design targeted strategies to improve employee contributions and enhance overall participation.
This analysis can help banks, employers, and financial institutions that manage 401(k) programs understand the factors influencing employee participation and contribution patterns. By identifying demographic groups that are underfunding their retirement savings, institutions can design targeted training, educational campaigns, or incentive programs to increase participation, enhance contributions, and ultimately maximize the growth of employees‚Äô retirement funds.

- <b>üì∞Detecting Fake News </b># sarafina15.github.io

  The goal of this project is to build a model capable of detecting fake news in online content. With the proliferation of misinformation, particularly on social media platforms, this project focuses on creating a system that can classify news articles or social media posts as either fake or real. By doing so, we aim to contribute to improving the reliability of information and aiding users in identifying trustworthy content.
Fake news is not a new concept. Stories, fairy tales, tall tales, rumors, what says, gossip, and did you knows have been around since people first learned to communicate. However, over the past century, we have seen the evolution and availability of media and news progress at a tremendous pace. It wasn‚Äôt so long ago; people got their news by sitting down and reading the paper while they drank coffee. Today, we can get the run down on sports, weather, local events, and national headlines by simply stating a request with the word ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù. All the information a person could want, literally in the palm of your hand when you want it, where you want it. With all this information, how are we to decide what information is accurate or not? As media competes for headlines, how do we determine what is false or misleading?


 **I am open to**:

- any collaboration work,
- machine learning projects(development or research),
- research internships and
- available to become a reviewer or PC member for Machine Learning/Data mining journals or conferences.
